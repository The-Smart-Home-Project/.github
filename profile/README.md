# The Smart Home Project


## Origin
My girlfriend and I had purchased 2 Alexa devices on sale. But, we didn't have any smart appliance. ðŸ˜ž

We purchased a few smart bulbs / lights / hubs, but it didn't help much. We wanted to automate our *whole house*, and just laze arround.

We searched out for available Home Automation solutions. But none lived up to exactly what we wanted. Following are the issues we found with these solutions.
- Low customizability
- High cost of hardware
- Time to setup each device with Alexa

We have arround 150+ electrical appliances in house, including open unused sockets. We *need* to control them all, via a simple instruction like

```Alexa, turn my study room's lights on```


## Mission

*Every appliance* in the house can be controlled via voice / remotely / automation.

We also want the solution to be
- Extremely customizable
- Affordable
- Easy to install
- Easy to modify
- Electrically safe


## The Solution
### Hardware
#### **1 Control Module**

#### **2 Control Module**
#### **Processor Module**

### Software
#### **Installation**
#### **Appliance Replacement (Modification)**
#### **Alexa Integration**
